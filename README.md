## Docker Configuration

### Dockerfile

The included `Dockerfile` creates a lightweight container based on Python Alpine:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

ARG VERSION
ENV VERSION=$VERSION

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY requirements.txt ./requirements.txt

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt && rm -rf requirements.txt

COPY ./src/bot .

CMD ["python", "bot.py"]

LABEL \
        org.opencontainers.image.title="bro-larry-bot"
```

### Docker Compose

The `docker-compose.yml` file provides an easy way to manage the bot:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  bot:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
      args:
        VERSION: 1.0.0
    container_name: brolarry
    env_file:
      - .env

networks:
  default:
    driver: bridge
```

### Docker Management Commands

```bash
# Start the bot
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Restart the bot
docker-compose restart

# Stop the bot
docker-compose down

# Rebuild and restart (after code changes)
docker-compose up -d --build

# View container status
docker-compose ps
```

## Usage Examples

### Daily Automatic Posting
The bot will automatically post the devotional for the current day at 9 AM in the configured channel.

### Manual Commands

**Devotional Commands:**
```
!devotional
```
Posts today's devotional immediately.

```
!randomdevotional
```
or
```
!rd
```
Posts a random devotional from the collection.

**Spiritual Practice Commands:**
```
!heart
```
Provides mindfulness and presence exercises inspired by Brother Lawrence's teachings.

```
!distraction
```
Offers guidance and techniques for managing distractions and returning focus to spiritual practice.

## Deployment

### Production Deployment with Docker

For production deployment, consider these additional steps:

1. **Use Docker secrets or external secret management**
   ```bash
   # Example with Docker secrets
   echo "your_discord_token" | docker secret create discord_token -
   ```

2. **Set up proper logging**
   ```yaml
   # In docker-compose.yml
   services:
     bro-larry:
       logging:
         driver: "json-file"
         options:
           max-size: "10m"
           max-file: "3"
   ```

3. **Configure health checks**
   ```dockerfile
   # Add to Dockerfile
   HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
     CMD python -c "import requests; requests.get('http://localhost:8080/health')" || exit 1
   ```

4. **Use a reverse proxy** (if exposing web endpoints)
   ```yaml
   # Example with nginx
   services:
     nginx:
       image: nginx:alpine
       ports:
         - "80:80"
       volumes:
         - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
   ```

## Customization

### Changing Post Time
Edit the `before_daily_devotional` method in `cogs/daily_devotional.py` to change the posting time:

```python
next_run = now.replace(hour=9, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)  # Change hour here
```

### Adding More Commands
Create new command methods in the respective cog classes using the `@commands.command()` decorator.

### Customizing Embeds
Modify the embed creation methods in each cog to change the appearance of the bot's responses.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Bot doesn't respond to commands**
- Ensure the bot has "Send Messages" permission in the channel
- Check that your command prefix is correct (default is `!`)
- Verify the bot is online and connected

**Daily devotional not posting**
- Check that `Devotion_Channel` ID is correct
- Ensure the bot has permissions in that channel
- Verify the devotional data file is properly formatted

**"No devotional found" error**
- Check that `devotional_prompts.json` exists in the `resource/` directory
- Verify the JSON format matches the expected structure
- Ensure there's a devotional entry for the current day of year

**Commands not working**
- Verify all cog files are present in the `cogs/` directory
- Check that the main bot file is loading all cogs properly
- Ensure there are no syntax errors in the cog files

### Docker-Specific Issues

**Container won't start**
- Check Docker logs: `docker-compose logs`
- Verify `.env` file exists and has correct values
- Ensure Docker has permission to read the project directory

**Bot can't read devotional file**
- Verify the `resource/` directory is properly mounted
- Check file permissions on the host system
- Ensure the JSON file is valid

**Container keeps restarting**
- Check for Python errors in logs
- Verify all required environment variables are set
- Ensure the Discord token is valid and has proper permissions

**Time zone issues**
- Set the `TZ` environment variable in docker-compose.yml
- Example: `TZ=America/New_York` or `TZ=UTC`
